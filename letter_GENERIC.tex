Greetings,

I write to highlight key-qualifications of my application for the role of THEROLE and express a strong ongoing interest in the role.

What I would say is my strongest qualification for the role is the one that cannot be taught and cannot be purchased. I have an insatiable hunger for greatness. It drives my every decision and motivates all action. My hunger is exemplified in the execution of my technical and professional qualifications.

As a freelancer, I have a strong record of delivering data-driven solutions to business problems. My methodological approach to finding solutions guides the practice of my craft. From the first day, I can be a contributing member of the YOURCOMPANY team.

Thank you for your consideration.\\

Cheers,
\\

Joe Mifsud
