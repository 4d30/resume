Greetings,

I write to express interest and highlight key-qualifications for the role of THEROLE at YOURCOMPANY. What makes me the ideal candidate for this role is that I make meaningful, actionable, insight out of data everyday.

Recently, I completed a project which clustered and characterized neighborhoods in Brooklyn, NY to identify optimal locations to open a small business. Ten locations were recommended for further investigation.

Currently, I am working on a project which pipes data from the wide-open internet, through statistical algorithms, into a relational database, and onto an executive-friendly dashboard.

I am a strong python programmer with expertise in NLP and a formal education in science and engineering. From day one, I would be a contributing member of the YOURCOMPANY team.

I look forward to hearing more on this opportunity.\\
\\
Cheers,\\
\\
Joe Mifsud
